# Background
The curiosity of this project came from the point where i started applying for the jobs in Data field. I want to analyse the job market. Luckily, i got the datasets from Luke Barousse
.

# Tools I Used
- **MySQL:** The core tool of this analysis. I used MySQL server, setup a local server, created databases, tables and loaded the datasets there. The queries to get the data are in Mysql too.

- **Visual Studio Code:** Setup a connection on VS code from the MySQL server, to write the queries and get the results. 

- **Git and Github:** Ofcourse for the version controling and project tracking. Also,for the repos to store and for external collaboration. 


# The Analysis


# What I Learned
This project provided several valuable insights about the current data job landscape:

- **Skills in Demand:** Beyond technical skills like SQL, Python, and various ML frameworks, employers increasingly value domain knowledge and communication abilities.
- **Specialization Trends:** There's a growing segmentation within data roles, with specialized positions (e.g., ML Engineer, Analytics Engineer, Data Storyteller) becoming more common.
- **Remote Work Impact:** The shift to remote work has changed geographical compensation patterns, with certain markets seeing salary adjustments based on location flexibility.
- **Tool Ecosystem Evolution:** While Python and SQL remain foundational, the ecosystem of specialized tools continues to expand, with increasing demand for experience with cloud platforms and data visualization tools.
- **Industry Variations:** Significant differences exist in how various industries structure their data teams and the specific skills they prioritize.
- **Entry Barriers:** Analysis of junior role requirements revealed potential gaps between academic training and industry expectations.

# Conclusions

Based on the analysis, several actionable conclusions emerged:

- For job seekers, developing a T-shaped skill profile (deep expertise in one area, broad knowledge across others) appears most marketable.
- Cloud-based data platform experience is becoming non-negotiable for many mid to senior roles.
- Regional job markets show distinct patterns, with certain cities emerging as specialized hubs for specific types of data work.
- Smaller companies tend to seek more generalists, while larger organizations can afford specialists - this affects job search strategy based on target company size.
- The gap between highest and lowest paying data roles is widening, suggesting increased specialization value.
- Continuing education in emerging tools and methodologies is essential for maintaining marketability, with particular growth in areas combining traditional data analysis with domain-specific knowledge.
